# FIFA World Cup Data Analysis (Excel Project)

This project analyzes FIFA World Cup match data using Microsoft Excel to uncover trends in:

- Goals scored
- Match outcomes
- Attendance patterns
- Stadium and city hosting frequency
- Tournament performance across years

This is part of my Data Analyst learning journey, demonstrating Excel data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualization skills.

## Objectives

- Clean and structure the raw dataset
- Create calculated fields such as total goals and match results
- Build pivot tables and pivot charts
- Develop an interactive Excel dashboard
- Generate insights from historical football match data

## Dataset Information

- Source: FIFA World Cup historical data
- Format: Excel / CSV
- Data type: Match-level data
- Key fields include: Year, Stage, Teams, Goals, Stadium, City, Attendance
